## üéì Master of Biorefinery ‚Äì Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree (EMJMD)
**Consortium:** University of Lille (France), Cracow University of Technology (Poland), University of Technology of Troyes (France)  
**Duration:** 2023 ‚Äì 2025  
**Scholarship:** Selected among over 300 international applicants for the prestigious EMJMD scholarship, fully funded by the European Commission. The scholarship covered tuition, monthly stipend, travel and relocation support.

### üî¨ Programme Background: EuroBioRef Legacy
This master's program builds upon the outcomes of the **EuroBioRef** project (European Multilevel Integrated Biorefinery Design), an FP7 European R&D initiative involving 29 partners from 15 countries. With a ‚Ç¨38 million budget, EuroBioRef developed an innovative and integrated approach to biomass valorization through chemical, biochemical, and thermochemical conversion. It also launched extensive training programs, which inspired the design of this master program to fill the global gap in advanced education in sustainable biorefinery.

### üåç Programme Overview
The EMJMD-BIOREF master's is a highly selective, multidisciplinary program preparing graduates for advanced roles in academia and industry. The program equips students with technical, analytical, and managerial skills relevant to biomass valorization, catalysis, and sustainable energy systems.

**Key Competencies Gained:**
- Design and optimization of chemical and biochemical processes for biomass conversion
- Advanced reactor engineering and heterogeneous/homogeneous catalysis
- Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and environmental risk analysis
- Sustainable industrial systems, territorial and industrial ecology
- Laboratory proficiency in biomass pretreatment, catalysis, and biofuel synthesis
- Scientific communication, teamwork, and cross-cultural project collaboration

### üìç Year 1, Semester 1 ‚Äì University of Technology of Troyes (France)
- Material and substance flow analysis, territorial & industrial ecology
- Bioeconomy: economic, legal, and environmental perspectives
