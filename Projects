##  Gas Stabilization Plant Modeling & Optimization (2024)
**Institution:** Cracow University of Technology, Poland  
**Tool Used:** CHEMCAD  

- Simulated a full gas stabilization unit to condition natural gas condensate by removing light hydrocarbons and water.
- Ensured dew point control below 21°F to prevent hydrate formation and pipeline blockages.
- Designed and analyzed a separation system involving a cooler, two-phase separator, stabilizer tower, and condenser.
- Optimized propane content in the stabilized condensate to below 1 mol% using flash separators and tower internals.
- Applied the Soave–Redlich–Kwong (SRK) equation of state to ensure accurate vapor-liquid equilibrium predictions.
- Evaluated condenser and heat exchanger duties to ensure energy efficiency and process reliability.

##  Extractive Distillation for Ethanol Purification (2024)
**Institution:** Cracow University of Technology, Poland  
**Tool Used:** CHEMCAD  

- Designed a three-column extractive distillation system for purifying ethanol to 99.5 wt% from a 12 mol% ethanol feed.
- Used ethylene glycol as a high-boiling separation solvent to break ethanol-water azeotrope.
- Modeled feed configuration, recycle streams, and separation specifications for steady-state simulation.
- Identified instability due to low glycol flow and corrected feed stream composition to stabilize the reflux ratio.
- Applied the NRTL (Non-Random Two-Liquid) thermodynamic model for non-ideal phase behavior.
- Conducted iterative simulation runs to optimize solvent-to-feed ratio and improve energy efficiency.
- Final simulation achieved converged operation, stable column profiles, and target ethanol purity.

##  Optimization of BTX Removal Using Carbon Disulfide (2024)
**Institution:** Cracow University of Technology, Poland  
**Tool Used:** CHEMCAD  

- Modeled a two-column BTX removal system using carbon disulfide (CS₂) as the solvent, aiming to purify BTX components while minimizing aromatic losses.
- Conducted simulations with distillation, flash separation, and cooling operations using MSRK and SRK thermodynamic models.
- Optimized process settings including temperature, vapor fraction, and contact time to improve CS₂ recovery and BTX purity.
- Performed sensitivity analysis on cooler vapor fractions, tracking CS₂ yield, benzene loss, and recirculation mass flow behavior.
- Identified optimal vapor fraction (~0.068) minimizing recirculation mass flow and energy use while maintaining high separation efficiency.
- Applied Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) to fine-tune parameters, resulting in minimal energy consumption and stable system performance.
